### TITLE OF PROJECT

The title selected for this project is HomeCareX. This is a cross-platform mobile application developed using Flutter Framework with Dart as its programming language. Cross-platform means using one codebase on multiple platforms (iOS and Android).


### INTRODUCTION

By looking around our surroundings and trying to identify gaps in frameworks, we found a manual solution to a problem that can be automated to eradicate most problems associated with that particular issue, making it more effective and efficient.

The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application for a handyman service that will allow customers to easily find and book reliable and professional handyman services. The app will provide customers with an easy-to-use platform to search for and book a variety of handyman services, ranging from plumbing, electrical work, painting, carpentry, and other general household maintenance services.


### PROBLEM STATEMENT

The current market lacks a comprehensive mobile app for handyman services that are easy to use, reliable, and provides a seamless experience for both customers and service providers. Customers often face challenges in finding trustworthy and skilled handyman services, while service providers struggle to reach a wider audience and grow their business.

The proposed handyman service mobile app developed in Flutter will address these challenges by offering a user-friendly platform for customers to find and book reliable handyman services. It will also provide a cost-effective solution for service providers to grow their business and reach a wider audience.

The app will have features such as a search bar for customers to search for services based on their location, a booking system to schedule appointments, a payment gateway to facilitate secure transactions, and a rating and review system to help customers make informed decisions. The app will also have a dashboard for service providers to manage their bookings, view their earnings, and update their profiles.

Overall, the proposed handyman service mobile app for Flutter will be a game-changer in the handyman services industry, providing a seamless platform for customers and service providers to connect and grow their businesses.

### LITERATURE REVIEW

The demand for handyman services has been on the rise in recent years, as people have less time to take care of home maintenance themselves. Many people have a hard time finding trustworthy and skilled handymen to do the work for them, which has created a need for a comprehensive mobile app that can connect customers with reliable service providers.

Various studies have shown that mobile apps are becoming increasingly popular for booking and paying for services, including home maintenance services. According to a report by comScore, mobile devices account for 60% of time spent on digital media, with mobile apps accounting for the majority of that time. This highlights the potential for a mobile app to provide a seamless and convenient platform for customers to find and book handyman services.

Research has also shown that user reviews and ratings are critical for building trust and confidence in the quality of services provided by handymen. A study by Nielsen found that 92% of customers trust recommendations from people they know, and 70% trust reviews from strangers. This underscores the importance of a rating and review system in the proposed HomeCareX app, which can help customers make informed decisions about the quality of service providers.

In terms of mobile app development, cross-platform development using Flutter has emerged as a popular choice among developers due to its ease of use, flexibility, and ability to build high-performance apps. Flutter has a rich set of pre-built widgets and a hot-reload feature that makes it easy to develop and test code, reducing development time and costs.

Overall, the literature suggests that a mobile app for handyman services like HomeCareX can provide a convenient and efficient platform for customers to find and book reliable services. The use of cross-platform development tools like Flutter can help reduce development costs and improve app performance, while a rating and review system can build trust and confidence among customers.

### AIM OF PROJECT

The aim of this project is basically to ease the stress factor of Ghanaians in their search for handymen and house maintenance personnel. By using user-friendly mobile apps for customers to book handyman services and providing real-time updates on their bookings, end-users enjoy a seamless and transparent application experience.

Also, it provides work for professional handymen.

### PROJECT SCOPE
The scope of the project will cover the design, development, testing, and deployment of the mobile app. The app will be designed to allow customers to search for and book handyman services, as well as to browse handyman service providers and their profiles. The app will be integrated with a payment gateway to allow customers to pay for services through the app. 

The app will also be designed to provide real-time updates on the status of bookings, including estimated completion times.

This project is currently limited to any locality in Ghana since the mobile application factors and filters personnel based on your location, for you to find handymen or maintenance personnel around you. 

Depending on how successful it will be in the future, there may be an extension across West Africa with web and desktop versions available. For now, it is available on iOs and Android platforms.

### OBJECTIVES

The key objectives of this project are as follows:

	Customer
 ● To develop a user-friendly and intuitive mobile app for customers to book handyman services.
 
 ● To provide customers with a range of handyman services that can be booked through the app.
 
 ● To allow customers to browse handyman service providers and their profiles before booking.
 
 ● To ensure a seamless booking process and scheduling of appointments.

 ● Once the job is completed, handymen can mark the job as finished and request payment from the user, with a review and rating system to improve their reputation.
 
 ● Handymen can view their job history and analytics in the app, including earnings and ratings, to help them track their progress and improve their services.

### METHODOLOGY

A hybrid methodology was used in this project. The waterfall and agile methodologies needed to be combined in order to achieve optimal productivity and efficiency. There was an idea of what the end product should look like but it was subject to some changes and experimentation. This required the project to have some structure but also be flexible hence the hybrid methodology being best suited for the project.

The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential development process that flows like a waterfall through all phases of a project (analysis, design, development, and testing, for example), with each phase completely wrapping up before the next phase begins.

The UI elements were built from tools provided by the Flutter Software Development Kit (SDK).
Cloud Firestore was used  as the back-end database.
Cloud Firestore is a noSQL database which means it does not follow any schema. However the data had to be modeled after a schema in order to keep this organized.

### PROJECT MOTIVATION

This project will go a long way to ease the discomfort associated with finding trustworthy professional handymen. The custom selection process of handymen by reviewing ratings and previous works, allows customers to select one who best fits the criteria they deem appropriate and necessary to assume the work. 
In addition to that, is the fact that the automation of this process is yet to be explored or understudied anywhere across Ghana as a mobile application though there is a web app available in that regard.
